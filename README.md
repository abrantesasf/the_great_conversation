## O que é a "_The Great Conversation_"?

Trecho do artigo [Great Conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Conversation),
retirado da [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/):

**The Great Conversation** is the ongoing process of writers and thinkers referencing, 
building on, and refining the work of their predecessors. This process is characterized 
by writers in the [Western canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_canon) making 
comparisons and allusions to the works of earlier writers. As such it is a name used in 
the promotion of the [Great Books of the Western World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World)
published by [Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Inc.)
in 1952. It is also the title of:

1 - the first volume of the first edition of this set of books, 
written by [Robert Maynard Hutchins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hutchins)
2 - an accessory volume to the second edition (1990), written by [Mortimer Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_Adler).

According to Hutchins, "_The tradition of the West is embodied in the Great Conversation that began in the dawn of history and that continues to the present day_". Adler said:

> "_What binds the authors together in an intellectual community is the great conversation 
in which they are engaged. In the works that come later in the sequence of years, we 
find authors listening to what their predecessors have had to say about this idea or that, 
this topic or that. They not only harken to the thought of their predecessors, they also 
respond to it by commenting on it in a variety of ways._"
